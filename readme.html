<p>This excerpt from the paper provides some specifics.  Although the
  drive.google.com links are broken the model code is available in this
  modeldb entry:

<p>"The simulations were performed in the Delphi-7 environment. The
mathematical analysis of the stochastic oscillations was performed
using Wolfram Mathematica 10 (Champaign, IL, USA). The Euler-Maruyama
explicit numerical scheme was applied for the integration of the
stochastic ordinary differential equations. The typical value of a
time step was 0.5 ms. The results were dependent on the numerical
parameter in a similar extent as for different realizations of
noise. The numerical realizations of the model are available from the
websites: the code in Wolfram Mathematica is at

<p> Python and JavaScript versions of Epileptor-2 are also available under the subfolders of the same name.

<p>The JavaScript version (available in the html file) produces the
following after this archive is downloaded, extracted, and the html
file is loaded into a browser (will not run from ModelDB):

<p>The python (verified in Python 3.6.9) version produces the following graphs</p>

<p>The code has been originally written by me (AV Chizhov) in Delphi. It was later re-implemented in Python by Artyom Zefirov, in Wolfram Mathematica by Dmitry Amakhin, and in Javascript by me.</p>
